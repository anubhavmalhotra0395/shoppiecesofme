                    "Piecesofme" driven by its curator, with a straightforward vision of making our pieces of jewelry a part of your everyday journey. We offer great quality at affordable price. All our pieces are long lasting, hypoallergenic and tarnish free. <br/>
                    We also have LUXE pieces in our collection, sourced and redesigned with the modern babe in mind. All the charms are 100% authentic designer pieces reworked into jewelry. We are not affliated with any of these brands.<br/>
